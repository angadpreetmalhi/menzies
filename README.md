Overview
This project involves analyzing flight operations data, focusing on various aspects such as time differences, aircraft types, and terminal locations. The code uses Python with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts.

Usage
Provide instructions on how to use the code and reproduce the analysis. Include any specific dataset requirements or configurations.

Analysis Steps
Step 1: Data Cleaning
The initial step involves cleaning the dataset, including handling NaN values and converting data types.

Step 2: Time Difference Calculation
Calculate the time difference between 'Off-Blocks' and 'Serv. End' and round it to the nearest minute.

Step 3: Aircraft Type Analysis
Analyze and visualize the distribution of different aircraft types.

Step 4: Flights Distribution
Explore the distribution of flights, including the total number of flights and average counts per weekday.

Step 5: Total Time Saved
Calculate and visualize the total time saved for each aircraft type.

Step 6: Terminal Location Counts
Count occurrences of 'Terminal 1' and 'Terminal 3' in the 'location' column.
